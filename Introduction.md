## Introduction:

"Hello, I’m Kumar, and I’ve been working as a DevOps engineer for the past 7 years. As highlighted in my CV, my expertise spans both Cloud and DevOps, with hands-on experience in AWS.

Cloud & DevOps Skills:

"In terms of DevOps, I have extensive experience with a variety of tools, including:

Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.
Jenkins and Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.
Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration and running micro-services applications.
Ansible for configuration management.
Shell scripting for task automation.
Git for version control.
Additionally, I utilize Jira for project management and Confluence for documentation."

### Collaboration & Responsibilities:

"My role involves close collaboration with developers to understand their requirements and provide the necessary infrastructure for automated application deployment. I also stay current with new tools and technologies that can streamline our deployment processes.

I’m responsible for supporting multiple projects across various environments, including Development, QA, UAT, and Production. My primary focus is ensuring that all CI/CD pipelines run smoothly and that all environments are stable and issue-free."


## Day to Day activities:

"My day-to-day activities start with a daily stand-up as part of our Agile process, where we discuss what we accomplished the previous day, what we plan to work on today, and identify any blockers that need resolution.

Throughout the day, I’m involved in a mix of tasks including writing and reviewing infrastructure-as-code scripts or pipeline definitions, collaborating closely with developers, QA, and stakeholders to enhance and maintain our CI/CD pipelines.

I work to ensure that our deployment process is smooth, automated, and reliable—whether it’s building new Jenkins pipeline stages, integrating quality gates like SonarQube, or configuring environment-specific deployments.

Additionally, I monitor infrastructure and application health using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch. If any alerts or failures occur, I jump into debugging logs, reviewing dashboards, and resolving incidents proactively.

I also take part in infrastructure improvements such as optimizing build time, scaling Jenkins agents, securing secrets, and automating repetitive operational tasks to reduce manual intervention."


## Project End to End:

In my current role, I work on a Java-based micro-services architecture with a React frontend. Our CI/CD pipeline is fully automated using Jenkins and ArgoCD.

All our backend services are containerized using Docker, and we orchestrate them using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). We manage deployments declaratively with Helm charts, and ArgoCD continuously syncs changes from Git to Kubernetes, enabling us to follow GitOps practices.

We use Terraform to provision and manage our AWS infrastructure, which includes resources like VPCs, EC2 for bastion hosts, RDS for our database layer, S3 for static content and backups, ALB for traffic routing, and Auto Scaling Groups for elasticity.

On the monitoring side, we use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization, and integrate alerting through Alertmanager into Slack.

I also script automation tasks using Shell and Python, manage secrets securely with AWS Secrets Manager, and ensure our infrastructure is modular, scalable, and production-ready.

Overall, I’m responsible for keeping our infrastructure resilient and secure, while enabling smooth, fast, and safe deployments for our development teams."
